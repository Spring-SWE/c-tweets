      I'm not here to make any money. However, I don't run advertisiments or any
      other form of cancerous montization practices and never will. That being
      said, I would love some help with server costs as if this project becomes
      too expensive I will be forced to take the app down. Please consider
      supporting my patreon if you'd like to help.
